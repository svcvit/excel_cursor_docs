# Excel Cursor: Detailed Feature Introduction

Excel Cursor is a revolutionary data processing tool that perfectly combines the power of AI with the popularity of Excel. Through simple conversations, users can easily complete complex data analysis tasks without programming knowledge.

## üîç What Makes Excel Cursor Unique

Excel Cursor differs from other AI-powered spreadsheet tools in several key aspects of design philosophy and functionality:

1. **Focus on Code Generation and Execution**: Excel Cursor's core function is to generate Pandas code based on user requirements and remotely execute it to process data. This approach is both efficient and flexible, capable of handling various complex data analysis tasks.

2. **No Automatic Insight Generation**: Unlike some AI tools, Excel Cursor doesn't automatically generate data insights for you. We believe that valuable insights come from users' deep understanding of their own data and business. Excel Cursor's goal is to help you implement your own analytical ideas more efficiently, not to replace your thinking process.

3. **No Data Generation**: Excel Cursor doesn't bulk generate new data based on table contents. We focus on processing and analyzing existing data rather than creating new data. This ensures processing speed and efficiency while avoiding the generation of fictitious data that could mislead decision-making.

## üßô‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Language Models and Prompts Used
- Currently using OpenAI's gpt-4o-mini model and Anthropic's claude-3-haiku, as they offer faster response times and are well-suited for the current tasks.
- Prompts will be published in the future; they are still being optimized.
