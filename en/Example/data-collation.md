## Prompt


```
This is a user order data. Please identify which fields are related to basic user information based on the header, help me organize them, and finally generate a user table. Note to deduplicate based on the member code.
```


## AI Response
First, based on the user's basic information, we can identify the following user-related fields:

- Member Name
- Member Gender
- Member Status
- Member Code
- Birth Date
- Info Completeness

Next, we'll generate a user table using these fields and deduplicate based on the member code. Here are the processing steps:

1. Extract fields related to basic user information from the original data.
2. Deduplicate based on member code, keeping unique user records.

Here's the pandas code to implement these steps:


```python
import pandas as pd
user_columns = ['Member Name', 'Member Gender', 'Member Status', 'Member Code', 'Birth Date', 'Info Completeness']
df_users = data["CRM Data"][user_columns].drop_duplicates(subset='Member Code')
df_output = df_users.reset_index(drop=True)
```


## Result
| Member Name | Member Gender | Member Status | Member Code      | Birth Date | Info Completeness |
| ----------- | ------------- | ------------- | ---------------- | ---------- | ----------------- |
