# The Birth of Excel Cursor: Making Data Processing Simple

## Chapter 1: A Fresh Graduate's Dilemma

Tom had just graduated from college and landed a job in the marketing department of a mid-sized company. Amid his excitement, he quickly faced his first challenge: his boss asked him to organize a complex sales data report.

Looking at the dense Excel spreadsheet before him, Tom felt overwhelmed. In college, he had only learned basic Office operations, and he was completely at a loss when faced with such a complex data processing task.

## Chapter 2: The Struggle of Self-Learning

"Don't worry, all newcomers face this situation," his colleague Sarah reassured him. "I was the same way when I started. I gradually got the hang of it after teaching myself some Excel tricks."

Over the next few months, Tom began to teach himself Excel. He learned some basic formulas and mastered the use of pivot tables. Gradually, he became capable of handling simple data analysis tasks.

## Chapter 3: Hitting a Skill Ceiling

However, as his work deepened, Tom realized that mastering these skills was far from enough. Sometimes, he needed to process thousands of rows of data, and Excel would become excruciatingly slow. He still couldn't handle more complex data analysis tasks.

Tom heard that some colleagues were learning VBA programming to automate Excel operations. He tried to learn it too, but found the learning curve too steep. Just as he was feeling discouraged, he heard about Python's pandas library, which could process data more efficiently.

## Chapter 4: Discovering a New Tool

"That's great!" Tom thought excitedly. But soon, he encountered a new problem: the company computers didn't have Python installed, and the IT department didn't allow employees to install software at will.

Just as Tom was at a loss, he happened to hear about a new tool called Excel Cursor. This tool combined the power of AI and could complete complex data processing tasks through simple conversations, without the need to install any additional software.

## Chapter 5: A Leap in Work Efficiency

With a "let's give it a try" attitude, Tom started using Excel Cursor. To his delight, he only needed to describe his requirements in everyday language, and the AI would automatically generate and execute the corresponding code. Complex data analysis became so simple that Tom felt like he had gained superpowers!

From then on, Tom's work efficiency greatly improved. He could not only easily complete various complex data processing tasks but also learned a lot of data analysis knowledge and skills in the process.

## Epilogue: Data Analysis in the AI Era

Excel Cursor not only changed Tom's way of working but also helped many newcomers like him find a shortcut to handling complex data. It made data analysis no longer the privilege of a few but a skill that everyone could master.

As Excel Cursor's slogan says: "Making data processing as natural as breathing." With the help of AI, complex Excel work finally became simple and fun.
